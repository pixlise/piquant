title: The PIQUANT GUI
---

 The PIQUANT GUI consists of a main window that has all the input information and a plot window for displaying the spectrum information output by the calculations. The plot window is not visible until a plot is produced.E

The main window has three sections: the action buttons at the top, input file names and the element fit control list in the center, and the output text box and Go! button at the bottom. Each of these is described in a subsection that follows.

The plot window is mostly self-explanatory. There is a toolbar at the bottom (provided by the matplotlib package that is used to display the data). The toolbar allows zooming, panning, setting the scales and axes (including log axes) and saving the plot as an image. The toolbar functions can be discovered by trying them as the results are visible immediately.

The following figure shows the main window and labels the sections as described above.
