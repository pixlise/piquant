title: Command Line Options
---

 Several modifications of the processing during the actions are possible using the command line options. These options take the form of a minus sign followed by a single letter. Some options have numerical values separated by commas after the letter. An example is –d,0 to select just the first detector from dual-detector spectra or –b,60,5,30 to optimize the background for a spectrum of the NIST 610 standard. These options are included for flexibility and are a slightly awkward to use at present. In the future the plan is to provide a graphical interface for using the most popular options that is more intuitive and has the values chosen graphically, from drop-down lists, or some similar method.

At present these options are passed directly to the command line program that does the actual calculations for the graphical user interface. For a complete listing of the options available as of this release and a description of their effects and accepted values, see the relevant page.
